# Data Engineering Pipeline Project with Reddit, Airflow, Celery, Postgres, S3, AWS Glue, Athena, and Redshift

This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive data engineering pipeline designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from Reddit into a data warehouse for analytics purposes. The pipeline leverages multiple tools, including Apache Airflow, Celery, PostgreSQL, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift, for efficient data processing and storage.

## Project Overview

This data pipeline project aims to:

1. **Extract** data from Reddit using its API.
2. **Store** the raw data in an Amazon S3 bucket.
3. **Transform** the data using AWS Glue and Athena.
4. **Load** the transformed data into Amazon Redshift for further analytics and querying.

The pipeline orchestrates the entire ETL process using Apache Airflow and distributes the tasks with Celery for scalability and efficiency. PostgreSQL is used to manage metadata and temporary storage during data processing.

## Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Reddit API**: The data source that provides Reddit data.
2. **Apache Airflow & Celery**: Orchestrate and manage the ETL process, including task scheduling and parallel processing.
3. **PostgreSQL**: Serves as a temporary data store and manages metadata.
4. **Amazon S3**: Storage for the raw data extracted from Reddit.
5. **AWS Glue**: Responsible for cataloging the data and running ETL jobs for transformation.
6. **Amazon Athena**: A SQL-based service used to transform and query data stored in S3.
7. **Amazon Redshift**: The data warehouse where transformed data is stored for analysis.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- An AWS account with permissions for S3, Glue, Athena, and Redshift.
- Reddit API credentials.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Python 3.9 or higher.

## How the Pipeline Works

1. The pipeline starts by extracting data from the Reddit API, pulling relevant posts and comments.
2. Airflow orchestrates the extraction and stores the raw data in an Amazon S3 bucket.
3. AWS Glue is used to create a data catalog and run ETL jobs that transform the data.
4. Amazon Athena queries the data stored in S3 using SQL for further transformations.
5. Finally, the processed data is loaded into Amazon Redshift, where it can be analyzed and visualized using BI tools.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, efficient, and fully automated data engineering pipeline using modern cloud technologies. It provides an excellent foundation for similar ETL workflows and can be easily adapted to other data sources and storage solutions.
